Number of binary trees possible with n unlabeled nodes is  2nCn/(n+1)

Number of binary trees possible with n labeled nodes is n!*(2nCn/(n+1)) 

Number of binary tree with given pre-order and n labeled nodes is 2nCn/(n+1)

Number of binary tree with given pre-order and post-order and n labeled nodes will be more than unique.

Number of binary tree with given pre-order,in-order and post-order and n labeled nodes will be unique.

Unique binary tree can be constructed with given pre and in order or post and in-order.

No of BST possible with n distict keys is 2nCn/(n+1)
